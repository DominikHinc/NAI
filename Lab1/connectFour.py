https://regentsctr.uni.edu/sites/default/files/games/Games/Connect_Four/Connect_Four_Rules.pdf. 

The board has dimensions of 6 by 7. 
The game pieces on the board are represented as follows:

 j
 =
 5 o o o o o o o 
 4 o o o o o o o 
 3 o o o o o o o 
 2 o o o o o o o 
 1 o o o o o o o 
 0 o o o o o o o 
   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 = i

p1 = x
p2 = y
The steps for Setting Up the Environment are:
In order to play this game, you will need to first install Python and then install the easyAI library. 
First, see if Python is already installed on your machine. If it is not, you can download Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/.

Install dependencies:

- Install the `easyAI` library, which is used to implement game AI Type in your terminal:

pip install easyAI


Run the game:

After having the environment set up and libraries installed, you can run this script as :

python connect_four.py
